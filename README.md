# Can you speak Python?

This is a Python challenge. Create pull requests (PR's) to this repository to
solve it. Upon PR submission, the GitHub action robots will check your code and
report back how well you did. You can then add more commits to your PR until
all tests come back green, which means you win!

The exercises are meant to test your knowledge of some important features of
the Python programming language and the [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) libraries. When it's not immediately
obvious to you how to solve an exercise using only a few lines of code, it is
likely you can learn a new Python trick by checking the links below the
exercise.


## Exercise 1: Make a pull request

 1. Fork this repository
 2. Create a new branch (name it whatever you like)
 3. Add a new file `gizmo.py` to the repository
 4. Create a pull-request from your new branch to the master branch of this repository

When `gizmo.py` exists, there should be `gizmo` python module that you can import.

For example:

```python
>>> import gizmo
```

## Exercise 2: Create a function
Add a `hello()` function to the `gizmo` module. The function should take two parameters: `name` and `country`. The `country` parameter is optional and should default to `'Finland'`. When called, the function uses the `print()` function to write the text `Hello {name}, how are things in {country}?` to the screen, where `{name}` and `{country}` should be the name and country given as parameters.

For example:
```python
>>> import gizmo
>>> gizmo.hello('Gizmo', 'Germany')
Hello Gizmo, how are things in Germany?
>>> gizmo.hello('Gizmo')
Hello Gizmo, how are things in Finland?
```

## Exercise 3: Use a loop
Add a `spell()` function to the `gizmo` module that uses the `print()` function
to spell out the word given as a parameter to the function, with dots between
the letters. Use a `for`-loop to implement this (no `split`/`join`).

For example:
```python
>>> import gizmo
>>> gizmo.spell('hello')
h.e.l.l.o
```

## Exercise 4: Use string formatting
Reading a bunch of files with only small differences in their filenames is a
very common occurrence in any research code. Add a function `relative_path()`
to the `gizmo` module that returns a list of files, including their relative
path, following the following pattern:
```text
'./subjects/mock_recording_{subject_identifier}.rec'
``` 
where `{subject_identifier}` is any string. Subject identifiers will be passed
to the function as a list of strings.

For example:
```python
>>> import gizmo
>>> subject_identifiers = ['subject1', 'subject2']
>>> names = gizmo.relative_path(subject_identifiers)
>>> print(names)
['./subjects/mock_recording_subject1.rec', './subjects/mock_recording_subject2.rec']
```

## Exercise 5: Create a Class
Add a class called `Gizmo` to your `gizmo.py` module.

For example:
```python
>>> from gizmo import Gizmo
>>> g = Gizmo()
```
[Learn how to create a Python class](https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/classes.html)


## Exercise 6: Add an attribute to your class
Modify your class such that when you create a new instance of `Gizmo`, you can give it a name.
The name is a string.
Afterwards, the name should be available as the `.name` attribute.

For example:
```python
>>> from gizmo import Gizmo
>>> g = Gizmo('Ariel')
>>> g.name
'Ariel'
```

[Learn how to add attributes](https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/classes.html#class-objects)


## Exercise 7: Add a method to your class
Modify your class such that it has a `.speak()` method. Calling this method
will make the `Gizmo` object print its name using the `print()` function.

For example:
```python
>>> from gizmo import Gizmo
>>> g = Gizmo('Ariel')
>>> g.speak()
Ariel
```

## Exercise 8: Add a NumPy array
Modify the `gizmo` module such that it has a `multiplication_table` function.
This function should return a two-dimensional NumPy array (i.e. a matrix) that
contains the [multiplication table from 1 to 12](
https://multiplicationtablecharts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Multiplication-Table.jpg)
that you had to learn in elementary school. A quick way to generate this table is to take the outer product of two vectors with numbers from 1 to 12.

For example:
```python
>>> import gizmo
>>> gizmo.multiplication_table()
array([[  1,   2,   3,   4,   5,   6,   7,   8,   9,  10,  11,  12],
       [  2,   4,   6,   8,  10,  12,  14,  16,  18,  20,  22,  24],
       [  3,   6,   9,  12,  15,  18,  21,  24,  27,  30,  33,  36],
       [  4,   8,  12,  16,  20,  24,  28,  32,  36,  40,  44,  48],
       [  5,  10,  15,  20,  25,  30,  35,  40,  45,  50,  55,  60],
       [  6,  12,  18,  24,  30,  36,  42,  48,  54,  60,  66,  72],
       [  7,  14,  21,  28,  35,  42,  49,  56,  63,  70,  77,  84],
       [  8,  16,  24,  32,  40,  48,  56,  64,  72,  80,  88,  96],
       [  9,  18,  27,  36,  45,  54,  63,  72,  81,  90,  99, 108],
       [ 10,  20,  30,  40,  50,  60,  70,  80,  90, 100, 110, 120],
       [ 11,  22,  33,  44,  55,  66,  77,  88,  99, 110, 121, 132],
       [ 12,  24,  36,  48,  60,  72,  84,  96, 108, 120, 132, 144]])
```

## Exercise 9: Use Numpy's fancy indexing
Modify the `multiplication_table` function so that it takes a parameter called
`zero_out_multiples`. When this parameter is set to an integer number, then the
multiplication table that is returned by the function will have all multiples
of the given number set to zero. Use NumPy's boolean indexing to accomplish
this. The default value of the `zero_out_multiples` parameter should be
``None``, meaning that no numbers will be set to zero.

```python
>>> gizmo.multiplication_table(zero_out_multiples=5)
array([[  1,   2,   3,   4,   0,   6,   7,   8,   9,   0,  11,  12],
       [  2,   4,   6,   8,   0,  12,  14,  16,  18,   0,  22,  24],
       [  3,   6,   9,  12,   0,  18,  21,  24,  27,   0,  33,  36],
       [  4,   8,  12,  16,   0,  24,  28,  32,  36,   0,  44,  48],
       [  0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0],
       [  6,  12,  18,  24,   0,  36,  42,  48,  54,   0,  66,  72],
       [  7,  14,  21,  28,   0,  42,  49,  56,  63,   0,  77,  84],
       [  8,  16,  24,  32,   0,  48,  56,  64,  72,   0,  88,  96],
       [  9,  18,  27,  36,   0,  54,  63,  72,  81,   0,  99, 108],
       [  0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0],
       [ 11,  22,  33,  44,   0,  66,  77,  88,  99,   0, 121, 132],
       [ 12,  24,  36,  48,   0,  72,  84,  96, 108,   0, 132, 144]])
```

## Exercise 10: Document your function using numpydoc
Add a docstring to the `multiplication_table` function. Use the "numpydoc" style
for this documentation. The documentation should contain:

 1. Short summary: a one-line description of what the function does.
 2. Extended summary: A longer description with more details about what the function does.
 3. Parameters: a list of all parameters that the function takes. For each parameter, describe:
     1. The parameter name
     2. Its expected type (int, bool, str, array, ...)
     3. What the parameter does
 4. Returns: a list of all values returned by the function. For each return value,  describe:
     1. The returned value's name
     2. Its type (int, bool, str, array, ...)
     3. What the returned value means

## Exercise 11: Build a generator
Add a function `generate_fibonacci_sequence(n)` to your `gizmo` module that will be a generator that `yield`s the first `n` numbers of the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).

For example:
```python
>>> import gizmo
>>> fib = gizmo.generate_fibonacci_sequence(5)
>>> while(True):
>>>     print(next(fib))
0
1
1
2
3
StopIteration
```

## Exercise 12: Build a NumPy array from a generator
Add a function `get_fibonacci_sequence(n)` to your `gizmo` module that takes a single parameter `n` and returns a NumPy array of the first `n` Fibonacci numbers. This function should use the generator you build in exercise 11 to generate the numbers, store them in a list and return the list in the form of a NumPy array.

For example:
```python
>>> import gizmo
>>> gizmo.get_fibonacci_sequence(10)
array([ 0,  1,  1,  2,  3,  5,  8, 13, 21, 34])
```

## Exercise 13: Read a CSV file with Pandas
The Gizmo git repository has a CSV in it called `titanic.csv`. This file contains information about all the passengers that were on board the Titanic when it sank. Add a function `get_titanic()` to your `gizmo` module that uses [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to load the CSV file and return it as a `DataFrame`.

For example:
```python
>>> import gizmo
>>> gizmo.get_titanic()

## Exercise 14: Select rows from a Pandas DataFrame
Add a function `get_titanic_children()` to your `gizmo` module. This function should read the `titanic.csv` file in this git repository and return a Pandas `DataFrame` with all the children, age ≤ 12, that were on board the Titanic when it sunk.

For example:

>>> import gizmo
